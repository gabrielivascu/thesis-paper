Most of the web browsers today offer their users the possibility of having their browsing data synchronized across their devices. This is a feature that has rapidly grown into a standard of modern web browsers. Unfortunately for GNOME users, Epiphany is a web browser that does not yet provide any support for synchronization. To help solve this shortcoming, I have created a synchronization support for Epiphany based on Firefox Sync, a browser synchronization scheme developed by Mozilla for Firefox. Therefore, Epiphany users can now synchronize their bookmarks, history, passwords and open tabs not only between Epiphany instances but also between Epiphany and Firefox instances.
